# Welcome to Living Chronicles

Welcome to the main page of the Living Chronicles living campaign. This campaign is run and maintained by Smokebomb Studios.

## Ethos

**Heroic Fantasy** is a term you will come around often if staying in the server. Well what does it even mean?

As players or even DMs, you need to remember that the story we are trying to tell in the server is one of heroes. Of ordinary people raised to heroes and triumphing over evil.

Sounds **Epic** right? Yeah that is the kind of story we are trying to tell. Your heroic fantasy can take the form of a ray of light in the darkness or a shadowy vigilante who helps the people. A chaos goblin who has a soft heart for the children of an orphanage. No matter what, **you are the good**.
