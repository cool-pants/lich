# Welcome/Introduction

Hello peeps, friendly neighbourhood pants here. Piggybacking on Mr. John Parsec the original maintainer of the DM Guides. Let's hear it from him.

Hello Dungeon Masters (DM), I am parsec. I have been in your shoes since 2020, learning the ways of this ancient art. Ancient? *Why yes!* Table Top Roleplaying Games, henceforth lovingly called TTRPGs, have been around since before we had victorian tables (seriously [look it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame#:~:text=The%20first%20wargame%20was%20invented,strategy%20to%20future%20army%20officers.)). Although the board game presentation is still relatively recent, it is my belief that its true origins must lie within the first human stories started to be told! Anyway... now you must be thinking one of three things:

- This narrator sounds awesome, should read more of what he has to say - *why thank you! keep reading <3*
- This guy thinks he is better than me - *Are you sure you are a DM? **False ego** is the first thing that dies DMing.*
- Can I skip to the good parts? - *Yes, yes you can. Checkout `#carlbot`  under bot guide for DM commands.*

Now that we have a rapport established let me take you through some cool ideas. It is my belief that if you like some of what is being presented, you should start to DM. If you like most of what is being presented? Start DMing here!

**B-but Mr. Parsec, there is so much lore, I am intimidated :(**

THERE IS NO PARSEC HERE, I AM YOUR ONLY GOD MUAHAHAHA.

Ahem-anyways. There is no need for you to know any of the lore to jump right in. But if you are a reader like myself, check out the [[Lore]] and the different [[Lore/Regions/index|Regions]] that we have. Select one which inspires you and [[Guides/Dungeon Master/DMA|begin]].
