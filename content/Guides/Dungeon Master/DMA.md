Sure, create a DMA Ticket [here](https://discord.com/channels/1278898468970299523/1278900273804476539/1367600232652734524)

Soon enough another ~Sith Lord~ DM will guide you to the ropes of DMA.

## Things to remember

Always follow the [[Guides/Dungeon Master/coc|Dungeon Master's Code of Conduct]]

### Here’s how the DMA process works:
- You will create your first adventure for the server! This will include you answering some questions and designing some encounters.
- I will give you any needed feedback on the adventure and then once it’s approved, I will make a quest post on your behalf.
- A member of dm support must either spectate or play in the game so they can give you feedback after the game.
- We have some parameters upon which we judge your games, If you successfully execute them, we approve you as a DM and you are free to run your games on the server!
