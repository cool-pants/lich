Hello! Before you start on your DM journey, please read and accept the following:

# DM Code of Conduct
This is the social contract that the GM signs with the players.
### 🔸 Jack of Rules
Understand the core mechanics, you do not need to know ALL RULES. But you should know the context of the rule system and their reason for existence.
### 🔸 Have Fun
You should not feel burnout, burdened, or overworked for your games. Its a hobby. A hobby should be fun and relieve said negatives instead of supporting it. “Hey fellas! We are ALL gonna have fun or we are NOT gonna do this.” We all contribute to having fun.
### 🔸 Respect the table
Players have taken time out of their day to be at your table, give them the respect they deserver and do not berate them. As someone in a privileged positions it is your responsibility to construct a safe environment for players to express themselves.
### 🔸 Take Charge
There are all sorts of players, including those who are assertive. As a DM, you are looked upon to resolve table conflicts that can break out. This may include stopping the game, or calling for moderator support. Make sure to remember that you are in charge of your table. 
### 🔸 Find your Voice
There are many ways to play the game, many elements that folks like about it. Some folks like tactical combat aspect while some like the fun lighthearted rp aspect. You can't please everyone, what you can do, is find what you enjoy.
### 🔸 You will make mistakes 
Sometimes you might do something that causes the game to be not fun for the players, and that is ok. Other times, you might make some mistake that the players are not even aware about, and you might be hard on your self for no reason.
### 🔸 Feedback  
Ask for feedback from your players, **stars** being the things they really enjoyed and **wishes** being the things they would like to see more. Also share your feedback for the table, what you enjoyed and you wish to see more from the players.
